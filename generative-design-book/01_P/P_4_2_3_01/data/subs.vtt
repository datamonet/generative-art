00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.730
Once upon a time,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.460
a spacecraft named Rosetta was launched into
the night sky.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.350
A long, long journey lay ahead of her to uncover
the mysteries of our Solar System.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.840
Rosetta carried a little passenger,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.900
the lander Philae.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.860
It had taken many, many years to dream up
this mission...

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.570
...and now, on 2 March 2004,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.720
Rosetta was on her way to the far off comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.280
The adventure of Rosetta and Philae

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.530
was inspired by stories they heard from grandfather
Giotto.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.960
Long, long ago men and woman on Earth gazed
in wonder at comets that appeared in the sky.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.710
What were these mysterious objects?

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.510
Some thought they might be caused by Earth
breathing into the sky,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.760
but no-one knew for sure...

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.900
until a Danish astronomer named Tycho Brahe
discovered that comets are very far away –

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.780
much, much farther from Earth than the Moon.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.000
How could we learn more about these distant objects?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.140
By trying to get close to them!

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.440
And getting close to a comet was exactly what
Rosetta and Philae planned to do,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.690
but before they got to theirs, they had a
lot to prepare.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.340
They listened in awe as Giotto told them

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.220
about a handful of spacecraft that had visited
other comets before them.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.560
I was one of the lucky spacecraft to fly very
close to the most famous comet of all:

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.720
Halley's comet.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.060
Halley's comet is very special.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.260
It is named after Edmond Halley,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.450
who discovered that many comets come back
regularly to our sky.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.750
He predicted that one of those comets would
return after 76 years, and it did!

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.760
Time and time again, Halley's comet has come
back,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.680
right on schedule every time.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.120
The last time, in 1986, I was there.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.340
Together with a bunch of friends from lots
of other countries,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.730
we set off to welcome this legendary comet.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:42.230
I was the bravest of all and flew less than
600 kilometers from the comet's nucleus.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:51.220
It was a harsh place, but the sight was amazing
and I sent pictures back home.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.240
Many more spacecraft have gone looking for
comets after us,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.160
like your cousin, Stardust, who flew by comet
81P/Wild,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.260
collected dust particles from the shiny tail,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.890
and sent them back home to be studied.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.580
Or, one of your other cousins, Deep Impact,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.900
who made a crater in comet 9P/Tempel to see
what's under the surface.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.140
Stardust flew by this comet a few years later
to look at this famous crater.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.180
We have learnt a lot about comets but much
more is still to be discovered.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.720
Comets hold many secrets about the early days
of our Solar System:

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.680
How did planets form?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.340
How did water arrive on Earth?

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.200
And you, Rosetta and Philae,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.260
are going to find out by doing what no space
probe has ever attempted:

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.820
orbit a comet and land on it!

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.960
Rosetta and Philae had a historic mission
ahead of them,

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.370
but the journey would be very long.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.270
It would take them ten years

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.190
and they would have to overcome many challenges
before they reached their destination.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.860
Rosetta needed lots of energy to get to the
comet

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.379
and got some from Earth and Mars

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:20.279
by flying around them seeing some beautiful
sights.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.780
Along the way, she and Philae also went to
places spacecraft hadn’t visited before.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.000
Rosetta found a diamond-shaped object, the
asteroid Steins,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.560
and took amazing pictures for everyone on
Earth to see.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.390
The diamond disappeared as the spacecraft
sped on.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.820
Further along the way a giant appeared:

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.930
Lutetia, an ancient rock 100km tall and 100km
wide

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.130
with big craters on the surface.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.660
Rosetta sent more pictures home of the amazing
encounter.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.680
This was still only the beginning of the adventure.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.140
But far from the energy of the Sun,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.260
Rosetta was very tired and needed to rest.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.300
Still travelling through space,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.020
she and Philae fell into a deep sleep,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.300
a sleep lasting for 2 years, 7 months and
12 days.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.340
Then, on the 20th of January 2014,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.500
with the help of everyone on Earth shouting
“Wake up, Rosetta!”

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.490
she opened her eyes and let everyone back
home know she was okay.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.210
There was much celebration

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.710
and Rosetta’s team quickly set to work checking
her health after the long slumber.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.040
There was still a long way to travel to reach
the comet

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.479
but Rosetta had plenty to do.

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.100
There was no time to lose.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.960
All of the experiments that were packed on
board had to be woken up,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.660
along with the lander, Philae.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.700
There was still some way to travel before
they reached the comet,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.449
and Philae in particular was impatient to
arrive.

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.149
“Rosetta, Are we there yet?”

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.180
“Are we there yet?”

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.160
When they got to the comet

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.699
they would find out all about its surface

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.870
and about the dust and gas around it,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.160
and the scientists back home would fit all
these pieces together, like a jigsaw puzzle,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.669
to learn about how comets work.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.460
“Are we there yet?”

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:40.480
But it would still take them a few months
before they'd reach Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.780
Before long Rosetta was able to see the comet
in the distance.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.290
She was getting closer and closer...

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.840
but there were still many challenges ahead.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.560
The route to the comet was complicated

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.120
and she had to carry out some difficult manoeuvres.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.289
She had to change her speed to match the comet’s

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:01.840
otherwise she would fly past.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.389
One false move and she might not make it...

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.580
There were 10 manoeuvres to complete, but
Rosetta was determined.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.680
As she checked them off, one by one, the comet
got closer and closer.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.020
It was the most wonderful sight that Rosetta
had ever seen.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.540
There was only a little way to go now,

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.880
but she knew that once she got there, there
would be no time for rest.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.680
She and Philae had the most important jobs
of their entire lives ahead of them...

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.820
Rosetta's exciting mission was to follow the
comet as it travelled around the Sun –

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.360
she would learn all about the comet

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.980
and how it changes as it gets warmer and warmer,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.100
while Philae would visit the surface.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.800
But as she got closer,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:58.380
Rosetta realised that the comet was much more
complex than people had first thought using

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.190
telescopes from far away.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.020
It almost looked like two comets stuck together,

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.500
and from some angles, its shape was really
rather strange!

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.980
It was the beginning of August,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:15.030
and Rosetta had to manoeuvre several times
to get closer and closer to the comet.

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:18.850
The nearer Rosetta got to this strange world,

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.060
the more wonders she discovered on its surface.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:29.080
There were craters, cliffs, and boulders the
size of houses.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.459
Rosetta spent many weeks studying the surface
of the comet,

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:36.379
sending lots of information back to Earth.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.960
She also started to analyse the dust and gas
around the comet.

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:45.010
But there was always one question in the back
of her mind:

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.990
where was Philae going to land?

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:54.080
No spacecraft had ever attempted to make a
soft touchdown on a comet.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.290
Philae started to pick some of his favourite
spots on the comet,

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.000
but Rosetta had to check with the experts
back home.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.360
[Indistinct muttering]

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:10.100
They thought long and hard, and eventually
found the best spot for Philae to land.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.180
Then Rosetta had to plan the exact route around
the comet,

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.260
to make sure that Philae would land in the
right place.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.860
Soon it was time for Philae to make the final
preparations for his great adventure.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:29.240
He checked that he had everything he needed
to land on the comet.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.500
Finally the moment everyone had been waiting
for arrived.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:39.000
As the world held its breath on 12 November
2014,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.400
Rosetta moved into the exact position needed

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.780
to make sure Philae would reach the landing site

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:52.070
Philae and Rosetta were sad to be going their
separate ways,

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:57.610
but excited at the same time because this
was what they had been waiting to do.

00:09:58.089 --> 00:10:00.660
Philae was away!

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.920
It would take seven hours to reach the surface,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.830
but Philae wanted to get started on his measurements
right away.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.510
He could soon see the surface in incredible detail,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.960
and the moment he had been dreaming of had
finally arrived.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.340
He had reached the surface of the comet!

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.100
But all was not right.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.110
His harpoons did not fire!

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.140
Philae realised he couldn't relax yet.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.100
He was rising from the surface again.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.820
Philae was scared he might drift off the comet
completely.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.000
This was not in the plan,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.519
but eventually he came back down again.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.640
However, as he looked around

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:57.260
he realized he had landed in a completely
unexpected location!

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.600
Philae immediately set to work on studying
his new home.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.380
It took him just over two days to conduct
all the experiments he had brought with him.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.450
After all his hard work, Philae began to feel
tired,

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:17.570
so he made sure to send all the data he had
collected back to Rosetta.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.019
As the Sun set over Philae's new home,

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:23.199
he fell into a deep sleep,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.860
safe in the knowledge that he did his main
job well,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:32.360
that his family of comet-chasing heroes would
be proud of his achievement.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.300
Who knows, perhaps one day,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.740
enough sunlight would fall on his new landing
site and wake him up...

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.760
Meanwhile, Rosetta continued studying the
comet,

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.769
learning new and wonderful things

00:11:46.769 --> 00:11:51.060
as she followed it on its journey through
the Solar System.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.890
It measured 4 km across, and from the gravitational
pull that Rosetta felt,

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.110
she could calculate the mass of the comet:

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.399
ten billion tonnes!

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.020
Although the comet looked like a giant rock,

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.200
it was made of something much lighter –

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.420
so much so that it would float on water!

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.500
Rosetta collected samples of the gas and dust
that streamed into space

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.910
in order to learn more about what the comet
was made of

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.320
and where in the Solar System it was born.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.700
One of the most important questions scientists
back home wanted to answer

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.190
was where Earth's water came from.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:39.060
Could it have come from comets and asteroids
billions of years ago?

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:44.399
Rosetta was surprised to discover that the
water vapour flowing away from her comet

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.579
had a different flavour to earth's oceans.

00:12:47.579 --> 00:12:51.019
The scientists wondered what it would mean
for their theories

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:55.260
of how the Solar System evolved.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.860
There were many other types of gases too,

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:05.019
and it smelt like a weird mixture of rotten
eggs, horse stables and marzipan!

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:10.850
Rosetta also collected thousands and thousands
of dust grains, small and large.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:15.790
Some of them seemed very fluffy, like the
head of a dandelion.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:21.950
As the days and weeks passed, the comet looked
more and more spectacular.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.730
Rosetta flew closer to get a better look,

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.620
but there she found herself surrounded by
a lot of dust.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:34.570
Although it wasn't as dangerous as when grandfather
Giotto flew past Comet Halley at high speed

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.220
many years ago,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.350
Rosetta still became disoriented and almost
lost her way,

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:46.959
so decided to continue her work from a safer
distance.

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:51.790
Rosetta began to see the surface of the comet
changing as they got nearer to the Sun.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:59.089
She saw jets of dust coming out of pits, and
patches of ice being revealed.

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:04.930
Even though the comet was becoming more active,
it was still quite cold on the surface.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.870
Rosetta measured temperatures around minus
one hundred degrees Celsius,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.240
and it was even colder underneath!

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.970
Thinking about the cold, she worried about
Philae,

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.959
who had been asleep for several months.

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:22.360
She didn't even know exactly where he had
finally landed,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.120
and wondered whether there was enough sunlight
there to recharge his batteries.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.960
Then, one Saturday in June 2015, she received
a phone call:

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.350
it was Philae!

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.670
He was awake!

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.970
She quickly told everyone on Earth...

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:47.110
[Indistinct muttering]

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.829
Rosetta wanted to tell Philae all that happened
while he had been asleep

00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:54.089
and the many exciting things she had learned
about the comet,

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:56.839
but the connection wasn't very good.

00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:58.350
It was very frustrating

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.510
and Rosetta had to move to different locations

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.899
to try to find the best spot for a better
connection.

00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:10.290
Philae hoped he would be able to do more experiments
on the comet surface

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:15.889
while Rosetta studied it from afar.

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:21.360
As the comet reached its closest point to
the Sun on 13 August,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:28.990
Rosetta and Philae were very excited to witness
this once in a lifetime event.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.550
Rosetta saw more and more gas and dust streaming
from the comet’s surface.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:37.370
At that time, she had to keep at a safe distance

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:43.730
because the comet was so active and the environment
was very dusty.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:48.839
Rosetta knew that astronomers back on Earth
were also observing the comet,

00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:52.610
and she enjoyed seeing the images of how it
looked from afar.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:57.620
It made her realize just how vast the comet's
tail was:

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.160
over 10 million kilometers.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.000
She explored some of the tail herself,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.649
on excursions that took her over a thousand
kilometers from the nucleus.

00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:13.670
There, she studied how the stream of charged
particles flowing from the Sun affects the

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.670
comet.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.450
Even though Rosetta was far away,

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.070
she often thought of Philae,

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.680
who she had not heard from since before their
closest approach to the Sun.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:30.029
She hoped that he had also enjoyed the view
on the comet when it was most active.

00:16:30.029 --> 00:16:34.329
Later, as they moved back towards the outer
Solar System,

00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:41.019
the comet became less active and it was finally
safe for Rosetta to get closer again.

00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:47.790
Whenever she flew over Philae’s home, she
listened out for any signals from him.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:53.360
She wanted to tell him about the amazing discoveries
that the scientists back home had made

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.470
using the data he had collected down on the
comet.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.910
They had found the surface to be much harder
than expected,

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.790
and that the comet contained many ingredients,

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.370
including some complex molecules

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:11.639
that could be the building blocks of life
as we know it on Earth!

00:17:11.639 --> 00:17:14.030
Even though Rosetta could not see or hear
Philae,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:19.019
she tried to make contact with him just in
case he was listening.

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:22.809
But unfortunately, they could not seem to
get connected.

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:26.459
Perhaps Philae had fallen back into a deep
sleep,

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:31.859
or maybe his radio was broken, but she was
still very proud of him.

00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:36.950
After all, he had accomplished so many of
his important tasks on the comet

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.200
and he was understandably tired!

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.230
Rosetta too had made many exciting discoveries...

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:50.070
She found patches of water ice on the surface
of the comet

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.919
and witnessed how the ice, heated by sunlight
during the day,

00:17:54.919 --> 00:17:57.999
turned into gas and escaped into space,

00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:01.720
while new ice formed again every night.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.220
Besides water,

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.919
Rosetta found many other molecules as she
studied the atmosphere of the comet,

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:09.379
including lots of oxygen.

00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:10.379
[Indistinct muttering]

00:18:10.379 --> 00:18:13.580
Scientists were very surprised to find so
much:

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.899
they thought that most of the oxygen would
have reacted with other atoms.

00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:24.759
But perhaps it had been locked into the ice
when the comet formed 4.6 billion years ago.

00:18:24.759 --> 00:18:29.169
The scientists were excited by what this discovery
could tell them

00:18:29.169 --> 00:18:32.109
about the history of the Solar System.

00:18:32.109 --> 00:18:36.320
By looking carefully at pictures taken by
Rosetta,

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.809
they also figured out how the comet got its
curious shape:

00:18:40.809 --> 00:18:46.789
it likely happened when two smaller comets
slowly crashed into each other,

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:48.350
billions of years ago.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:54.559
The scientists had also long wondered what
the comet looked like from the inside.

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:57.549
To find out, they studied the radio beams

00:18:57.549 --> 00:19:01.470
that Rosetta and Philae had sent to one another
through the comet.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:06.129
They also measured how the signals that Rosetta
sent back to Earth

00:19:06.129 --> 00:19:11.679
changed as the comet’s gravity gently tugged
on her while she flew around it.

00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:17.150
These experiments showed that the comet had
no caverns under the surface larger than a

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.470
hundred metres.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:24.820
In fact, it was made up of a mix of loosely
packed dust and ice grains on the inside:

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:35.740
the comet was fluffy under its hard crust!

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:41.499
Scientists also came to understand that comets
were made of the dusty and icy material

00:19:41.499 --> 00:19:44.879
left over after the planets were formed,

00:19:44.879 --> 00:19:49.509
and so they contained some of the oldest and
best preserved material

00:19:49.509 --> 00:19:52.179
from the birth of our Solar System.

00:19:52.179 --> 00:19:54.419
Rosetta had made even more remarkable:

00:19:54.419 --> 00:20:00.840
she found ingredients that were crucial for
the origin of life on Earth.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.309
Perhaps comets had helped seed the Earth with
these important ingredients

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:09.559
when our planet was still very young.

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:14.590
Scientists would definitely be busy analysing
Rosetta’s findings for decades.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.470
Her mission had been a huge success.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.950
After a long search,

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:24.360
she had even managed to find the strange place
where Philae had ended up,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.789
fast asleep in a dark corner of the comet.

00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:31.600
But now, once again far from the Sun,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.009
Rosetta was not generating very much power

00:20:34.009 --> 00:20:38.899
and soon would not have enough to carry out
her investigations.

00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:40.309
She could go back to sleep

00:20:40.309 --> 00:20:46.080
but instead decided to undertake one last,
ambitious challenge:

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.799
she was going to follow in Philae’s footsteps
and land on the comet!

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:57.260
Rosetta was tired after 12-and-a-half years
travelling through space,

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.289
but she was very excited about her last tasks:

00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:05.609
She would finally see up close some of the
amazing sights

00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:09.190
she had been observing from a distance for
the past two years,

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.639
and she’d get to sample the comet’s gases

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:16.409
closer than she had ever dared to go before.

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:17.590
It would not be easy,

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.350
but the experts back home had everything figured
out,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.039
and the date was set.

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:24.190
[Indistinct muttering]

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:32.979
Rosetta would be targeting a really interesting
place on the head of the comet.

00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:36.849
She wasn’t going to be able to talk to Earth
ever again

00:21:36.849 --> 00:21:39.210
once she was on the comet's surface –

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.979
after all, she was never designed to land
–

00:21:41.979 --> 00:21:48.130
so she would have to send back her last images
and data as quickly as possible,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.919
before saying her final goodbyes.

00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:55.299
Even though her incredible journey was nearly
complete, she knew that,

00:21:55.299 --> 00:21:59.090
just like the other comet explorers that had
gone before her,

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:04.049
the legacy of her amazing mission would live
on forever.

00:22:04.049 --> 00:22:07.109
She felt lucky to have had so many friends

00:22:07.109 --> 00:22:20.109
and hoped they would still think about her
and Philae from time to time.

00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:31.970
Finally, after 786 days at the comet,

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:37.379
the last day of her extraordinary adventure
arrived...

00:22:37.379 --> 00:22:42.320
On 30 September 2016,

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.940
Rosetta started her descent to the surface
of the comet.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.499
She made unique measurements

00:22:48.499 --> 00:22:53.049
and took many close-up photos of the wonderful
sights,

00:22:53.049 --> 00:22:56.369
thinking of the future scientific discoveries
to come,

00:22:56.369 --> 00:23:01.129
before she touched down on the comet for her
well deserved rest.

00:23:01.129 --> 00:23:08.080
[Annotation on text message: Mission complete!]

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.870
[Annotation on banner: Goodbye Rosetta!]

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:21.980
[Annotation on book: Once upon a time…]

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:29.539
And so ends the amazing adventure of our two
extraordinary explorers,

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:47.139
Rosetta and Philae at Comet 67P.

00:23:47.139 --> 00:24:03.979
Farewell, dear friends.

00:24:03.979 --> 00:24:10.129
We've found them!
